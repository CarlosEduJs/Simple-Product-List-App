# Product List With Cart Main

1. *What does this site do?*

 1. The user can add products to the cart, and it includes features to increase and decrease the quantity of items. It has a simulated purchase system that displays a modal when the order is confirmed.

 2. The project was adapted from a FrontEnd Mentor challenge.

 3. Here are the challenge requirements: Your users should be able to:

    - Add items to the cart and remove them
    - Increase or decrease the quantity of items in the cart
    - See an order confirmation modal when they click "Confirm Order"
    - Reset their selections when they click "Start New Order"
    - View the optimal layout for the interface based on their device's screen size
    - See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page


> Adapted project, as its requirement was only to do it without frameworks, but I decided to adapt it to train more NextJs.
